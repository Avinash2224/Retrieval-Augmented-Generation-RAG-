## ‚úÖ 1. Test Queries & Results

| **Query**                                  | **Retrieved Evidence (Snippets)**                                         | **System Answer**                                                                 | **Evaluation**         |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|

| When and where was the Titanic constructed?| ...Construction of the Titanic began... Harland & Wolff, Belfast...       | The Titanic was constructed at the Harland & Wolff Shipyard in Belfast, Ireland. | ‚úÖ Correct and detailed |
| How did the Titanic sink?                  | ...As the ship sank... frantic struggles... water rushed in...            | The Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg; water flooded compartments, causing it to sink. | ‚úÖ Factual and sourced |
| What is the difference between the Titanic and Britannic?| ...Olympic, Titanic, and Gigantic (renamed Britannic)...         | The Titanic and Britannic were sister ships; Britannic was originally named Gigantic. | ‚úÖ Correct sister ship info |
| Who was Captain Smith?                     | ...washing away Captain Smith...                                          | Captain Smith was the Titanic's commanding officer.                              | ‚úÖ Direct and accurate  |
| What is the capital of France?             | *(No relevant evidence)*                                                  | Sorry, I could not find an answer based on the current documents.                | ‚úÖ Properly handled     |
| Explain all main modules in this codebase. | *(Project directory and code structure)*                                  | The codebase is divided into modules for loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, answering, logging, and error handling. | ‚úÖ Coherent module summary |

## üß† 2. System Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

- **Accurate Context Retrieval**  
  The retriever (FAISS + SentenceTransformers) found highly relevant passages for most user queries.

- **LLM + Groq Integration**  
  Fast and factual responses using Llama 3 via Groq API when grounded evidence is provided.

- **Graceful Handling of Missing Evidence**  
  If a question is not covered in the corpus, the system respectfully returns a fallback message.

- **CLI Observability**  
  Logs every question, evidence retrieval, and generated answer with timestamps for debugging or traceability.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Chunk Noise**  
  Some evidence snippets contain irrelevant introductory text, making answers vague or delayed.

- **Corpus Dependency**  
  Responses are only as complete as the information available in the `.pdf`, `.md`, or `.txt` files ingested.

- **Prompt Design**  
  A few answers (especially open-ended or comparative ones) could be improved by refining the prompting template or chunk overlap strategy.

---

## üìå Next Steps

- Optimize chunking (consider token-aware or sliding-window methods).
- Refine generation prompts to enforce tighter grounding to evidence.
- Expand corpus to improve coverage and answer quality.
