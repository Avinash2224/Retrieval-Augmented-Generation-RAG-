# Evaluation Report — RAG CLI System

## 1. Test Queries & Results

We tested the system against a set of diverse questions to evaluate its retrieval and generation performance. Below is a summary of the queries, what evidence was retrieved, the answers provided by the system, and our evaluation.

* **What was the name of the ship?**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* Mentions of "Titanic" and "Titanic began her maiden voyage"
  *Answer:* "The ship was the RMS Titanic."
  *Evaluation:* Correct and precise.

* **When and where was the Titanic constructed?**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* "Construction of the Titanic began... Harland & Wolff, Belfast..."
  *Answer:* "The Titanic was constructed at the Harland & Wolff Shipyard in Belfast, Ireland."
  *Evaluation:* Correct and detailed.

* **How did the Titanic sink?**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* "As the ship sank... frantic struggles... water rushed in..."
  *Answer:* "The Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg; water flooded compartments, causing it to sink."
  *Evaluation:* Accurate and well-grounded.

* **What is the difference between the Titanic and Britannic?**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* "Olympic, Titanic, and Gigantic (renamed Britannic)..."
  *Answer:* "The Titanic and Britannic were sister ships; Britannic was originally named Gigantic."
  *Evaluation:* Factual and clearly explained.

* **Who was Captain Smith?**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* "Washing away Captain Smith..."
  *Answer:* "Captain Smith was the Titanic's commanding officer."
  *Evaluation:* Direct and correct.

* **What is the capital of France?**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* No relevant data found in the corpus.
  *Answer:* "Sorry, I could not find an answer based on the current documents."
  *Evaluation:* Gracefully handled with an appropriate fallback response.

* **Explain all main modules in this codebase.**
  *Retrieved Evidence:* Directory and code structure
  *Answer:* "The codebase is divided into modules for loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, answering, logging, and error handling."
  *Evaluation:* Coherent and well-structured summary.

## 2. System Analysis

### Strengths

* **Contextual Retrieval Accuracy**
  The system consistently pulled highly relevant snippets from the knowledge base for factual and procedural queries.

* **Fast and Grounded Generation**
  Integration with Groq's Llama 3 API delivers timely, well-grounded responses based on the retrieved evidence.

* **Fallbacks for Unsupported Queries**
  When the system couldn’t find relevant information (e.g., unrelated facts like "capital of France"), it returned a clear and respectful fallback message.

* **Traceability via CLI Logging**
  Every query and its associated evidence, answer, and timestamp are logged for easy review and debugging.

### Limitations

* **Chunk Quality**
  Some retrieved snippets include excess context or boilerplate, which can dilute the clarity of the answer.

* **Corpus-Dependent Knowledge**
  The system is limited by the scope of documents placed in the `sample_corpus/` directory. No external search is performed.

* **Prompt Design Can Improve**
  For some open-ended questions, better results could be achieved with improved prompting and chunk overlap.

## 3. Recommendations

* Improve chunking strategy by implementing token-aware or sliding-window approaches.
* Refine prompting templates to guide the LLM toward more concise and grounded responses.
* Expand the corpus with more documents to enhance coverage and depth of answers.

## Evaluation Framework

We used a diverse set of test questions to evaluate system performance across different scenarios:

| Test Scenario        | Sample Question                                                    | Expected Summary                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Factual Retrieval    | When and where was the Titanic constructed?                        | Construction began in 1909 at Harland & Wolff Shipyard, Belfast, Ireland        |
| Procedural Knowledge | How many lifeboats did Titanic carry and why was it controversial? | 20 lifeboats; not enough for all passengers; a major safety concern             |
| Comparative Analysis | What was the relationship between Titanic, Olympic, and Britannic? | All were sister ships; Britannic was originally called “Gigantic”               |
| Edge Case (No Info)  | Who was the captain of the RMS Lusitania?                          | Should return a fallback due to lack of relevant info in the documents          |
| Complex Reasoning    | Summarize key design flaws leading to Titanic’s sinking.           | Lifeboat shortage, flawed watertight bulkheads, brittle steel, lack of training |

Each of these questions helps assess the system's ability to perform grounded generation, retrieve relevant facts, handle out-of-scope queries, and summarize complex information.
