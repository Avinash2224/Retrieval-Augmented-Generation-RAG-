## 1. Test Queries & Results

| **Query**                                  | **Retrieved Evidence (Snippets)**                                         | **System Answer**                                                                 | **Evaluation**         |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| What was the name of the ship?             | ...Titanic began her maiden voyage... / ...Titanic...                     | The ship was the RMS Titanic.                                                    | Correct and precise    |
| When and where was the Titanic constructed?| ...Construction of the Titanic began... Harland & Wolff, Belfast...       | The Titanic was constructed at the Harland & Wolff Shipyard in Belfast, Ireland. | Correct and detailed   |
| How did the Titanic sink?                  | ...As the ship sank... frantic struggles... water rushed in...            | The Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg; water flooded compartments, causing it to sink. | Factual and sourced    |
| What is the difference between the Titanic and Britannic?| ...Olympic, Titanic, and Gigantic (renamed Britannic)...         | The Titanic and Britannic were sister ships; Britannic was originally named Gigantic. | Correct sister ship info |
| Who was Captain Smith?                     | ...washing away Captain Smith...                                          | Captain Smith was the Titanic's commanding officer.                              | Direct and accurate    |
| What is the capital of France?             | *(No relevant evidence)*                                                  | Sorry, I could not find an answer based on the current documents.                | Properly handled       |
| Explain all main modules in this codebase. | *(Project directory and code structure)*                                  | The codebase is divided into modules for loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, answering, logging, and error handling. | Coherent module summary |

## 2. System Analysis

### Strengths

- **Accurate Context Retrieval**  
  The retriever (FAISS + SentenceTransformers) found highly relevant passages for most user queries.

- **LLM + Groq Integration**  
  Fast and factual responses using Llama 3 via Groq API when grounded evidence is provided.

- **Graceful Handling of Missing Evidence**  
  If a question is not covered in the corpus, the system respectfully returns a fallback message.

- **CLI Observability**  
  Logs every question, evidence retrieval, and generated answer with timestamps for debugging or traceability.

---

### Limitations

- **Chunk Noise**  
  Some evidence snippets contain irrelevant introductory text, making answers vague or delayed.

- **Corpus Dependency**  
  Responses are only as complete as the information available in the `.pdf`, `.md`, or `.txt` files ingested.

- **Prompt Design**  
  A few answers (especially open-ended or comparative ones) could be improved by refining the prompting template or chunk overlap strategy.

---

## Next Steps

- Optimize chunking (consider token-aware or sliding-window methods).
- Refine generation prompts to enforce tighter grounding to evidence.
- Expand corpus to improve coverage and answer quality.

## Evaluation Framework

This section evaluates the RAG system using a diverse set of question types to test factual accuracy, retrieval quality, and reasoning capabilities.

### Updated Test Questions

| # | **Scenario**         | **Test Question**                                                  | **Expected Answer Summary**                                                               | **Notes / Results**         |
| - | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1 | Factual Retrieval    | When and where was the Titanic constructed?                        | Construction began in 1909 at Harland and Wolff Shipyard, Belfast, Ireland                |  /  / Add evaluation note |
| 2 | Procedural Knowledge | How many lifeboats did Titanic carry and why was it controversial? | 20 lifeboats; not enough for all passengers, led to public safety concerns                |  /  / Add evaluation note |
| 3 | Comparative Analysis | What was the relationship between Titanic, Olympic, and Britannic? | All were sister ships; Britannic was originally named “Gigantic”                           / / Add evaluation note |
| 4 | Edge Case (No Info)  | Who was the captain of the RMS Lusitania?                          | No relevant information in documents; system should respond with a fallback/no-evidence   |  /  / Add evaluation note |
| 5 | Complex Query        | Summarize key design flaws leading to Titanic’s sinking.           | Multiple causes: insufficient lifeboats, flawed watertight bulkheads, brittle steel, etc. |  /  / Add evaluation note |

>  = Accurate and grounded in retrieved evidence
>  = Incorrect, hallucinated, or vague answer
